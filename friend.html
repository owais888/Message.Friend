      You’ve always been by my side since we were little kids. From youngsters with scraped knees to teenagers with
      broken hearts, we’ve always had each other’s backs. You’re the best friend anyone can ask for, and I just want to
      thank you for being with me through all this time. I love you best friend!

      No matter where life takes us to, I will always be there for you, because true friends always stick together and
      never leave each other. No matter what obstacles life may throw at us, we will always overcome it all, because two
      is always better than one. And you plus me equals an unbeatable and unstoppable team. I cherish you so much, my
      dearest friend.

      You are more than a friend. You’re my sister, my partner-in-crime, my other half. You know me better than I know
      myself. You know what I like, what I love, what I hate. You applaud my passions and tolerate my faults. You’re
      there for me, always. And it’s not always about what we say, or what we do – because you, by yourself, is enough.
      You, with your smile, your laugh, your friendship – it’s more than I deserve. We’ve laughed, we’ve cried, and
      we’re stronger than ever. Because there’s no me without you.
      You’re part of me – part of me, my life, my family, my entire world.
      We’re best friends because we can go for long stretches of time without talking and it won’t damage the
      relationship. We always pick up where we left off. Surfaces changes mean nothing to us. You could become a vegan
      who goes by Moonshadow and attends Burning Man, and I would still feel closer to you than anyone else. We don’t
      need common interests in order to connect. We don’t need a mutual love of music or sports or whatever to keep us
      together.

    </h4>








    <p class="card-body" style="font-size: 20px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.979);">

      You are a lucky person if you have a loyal friend or friends who stand by your side and have your back in times of
      need. A cutest paragraph for best friend can help you show them how much you care your friendship.

      You happened to be someone who I don’t expect I will get along so well and be happy with. You were a familiar
      stranger as you were someone whom I don’t know before. But guess what? You turned out to be the best thing and one
      of the most beautiful things that ever happened to me in life. I love you, my darling friend.

      Who would I text when I can’t sleep? Who would I FaceTime until 2AM, just because we can? Who would talk me
      through every family crisis, every wardrobe malfunction, every anxiety attack? I tell you all the secrets I can’t
      tell my mom. You know everything – everything about me, probably better than I know myself. You know I tend to
      overreact, but you don’t judge me for it. You never have. You’ve been there for the smallest victories and the
      biggest catastrophes.

      We’re best friends because you make feel less alone in this world. It’s amazing how often you can feel
      disconnected from people. It’s amazing how many people can betray you, or fail to understand the words that are
      coming out of your mouth. When I see you, it’s a burst of reassurance that I’m not the only who looks at the world
      this way. There’s someone else. And that someone is you.

      To my wonderful friend, today like every other day, I pray that our friendship will always blossom and knows no
      end. It will always stay fresh like the early morning river. Each and every day will be another chance to cherish
      and love each other so much more than ever before and we will always be together till the end of time. I love you
      beyond the stars, my adorable friend.
      <br>
      A true friend always understands even when the other one is not saying or doing anything, and you have always
      understood me even in the moment when I am not saying anything as the best and true friend which you are. Thank
      goodness that our path crossed and I met an understanding friend like you. I cherish every moment with you, my
      lovely friend and I love you so much.

      You’ve been there for the heartbreaks, the disappointments, even the failures. You know about the boy who broke my
      heart, and we both know you’ll hit him with your car if you ever get the chance. You were there when I didn’t get
      into that dream school, when I flunked that exam. You cheered me up and brought me ice cream. You took me dancing
      when I wanted to cry – you made me breakfast when I crashed on your couch.

      Thank you for being you. You are incredible my dear, and I can’t wait to constantly remind your husband that he
      got crazy lucky and out kicked his coverage big time. You are beautiful inside and out. On the outside, you are so
      gorgeous; you’re very own unique and incredible definition of beauty, and I know I’m one of many who see it.
      You’re intimidating to stand next to in pictures because I know your light shines so bright, but I’ll gladly stand
      next to you and take a picture, because I’m so excited to show the world how breathtakingly beautiful my best
      friend is. On the inside you are even prettier, with a warm heart, a sharp mind and an unbelievable personality.
      You are hands down the funniest person I know, and I still can’t believe that someone as funny and hilarious as
      you chooses to spend her time with someone as dweeby and awkward as me. I mean, half the time we’re laughing at
      some fail I had or something stupid I did, so I guess I contribute a little bit to our constant laughing. You are
      so kind and so sweet, and have the biggest heart of anyone I know. God spent a little extra time when he made you,
      because you’re the total package: you’re beautiful, awesome and amazing, all wrapped in one, and I’m so lucky he
      put you in my life—he knows I’d be lost without you.

      I feel so blessed to have a friend like you. I never thought angels could exist in this world, but here you are in
      the flesh. Your friendship is so precious to me that I wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world, not even a
      million bucks! I wouldn’t trade it for a chance at becoming famous or for an all-expenses paid trip to anywhere.
      I’d rather be poor, untraveled, and unknown than be without a friendship as wonderful as yours.

      Every good TV show, every good movie, has a dynamic duo. That’s us. I think we could have our own show, and
      honestly, I think people would watch it. Because we’re the kind of people that laugh so hard we start to cry. We
      have our own jokes, our own routine, our own language – on second thought, maybe the TV show isn’t such a great
      idea. The point is, you get me. You understand me. We understand each other. You know when I’m feeling down, the
      standard “I’m fine” is never enough for you. You just know better. And I’m glad you know better, because sometimes
      I feel like no one understands me. But you always do. You always know what to do and what to say. I don’t know
      how, but you’ve perfected the art of tending to me, myself, and I

    <p class="card-body" style="font-size: 20px;text-align: center;  background-color:  rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.979);">


      You were always that person I never expected to be friends with. I thought we would never get along. But when we
      came together, it was like something clicked and I knew that you would be a part of my life forever. I am so glad
      we didn’t remain strangers because your friendship feels like a lifelong gift that keeps on giving. Thank you for
      being my dear friend.

          I might not be able to know everything about you, my dearest. Because each and every day is another avenue for
          me to know you a bit more than before; to get to be closer to you and cherish you so much more than ever
          before. And I want you to know that one of the reasons why I’m with you is to know you much better. I adore
          you,<br> <br> my beautiful friend.
          Just as true friendship is not measured by how far we’ve been together but rather how well it has been between
          us. So also real bonding is not measured by the time we’ve spent together in each other company but rather the
          solace and solitude that comes with being with you, my awesome friend. I love you more than you know. <br>
